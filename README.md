Homework Reminder App 

  Our Homerwork reminder app was developed to help students keep track of their assignments. With our app the user is able to create classes and create tasks.
Tasks are added to the specific class where you can view them in the task list. You can delete tasks from the list if you finish it early. Classes are also able to be deleted.
When creating a task the user will enter a name, due date and priority level. The tasks will be sorted based on priority level but can also be sorted by due date if the 
user chooses. There is a notification system which will alert the user when a due date is approaching and on the day an assignment is due. There is a sound
and haptic that will alert the user along with an on screen notification saying which assignment is due soon. The app is very user friendly and allows for anyone to 
use with very little trouble.

## Prerequisites
Android Studio 
## Run Instructions
1. Using Android  Studio and Github, pull the entire project code into Android Studio. If you are having trouble finding it in our repo, [here](https://github.com/stoneyboi/Homework_Reminder) is another link that you can use. This link contains only the source code to run the app and not necesarily the tests. 
2. Use the AVD manager in android studio to start an emulator for the app (doesnt matter what type of phone, you just want API 30 and the software system R
3. Click the Run icon on the top bar to run the app in the emulator 

(NOTE: The first few minutes in the emulator are slightly buggy and slow since most processes are still being installed on the virtual device. )
