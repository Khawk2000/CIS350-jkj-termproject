# Introduction

(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)
Our project will be about designing an Android app for college and high school level students. The app will help remind the studnets when homework assignments are due, it will send a series of notifications to the user to make sure the homework/task was fininshed. We want to make a digital planner app that can also help take some difficulty out of everyday life. Our app, "HomeworkHelp" will be used as a tool for the busy students' life to help them with their everyday tasks.

The user can add tasks, delete or change the tasks. The tasks themselves can be customized with individual notes like which class is it for, how many points is it worth, priority level and due date. The user can then view the tasks in a range of calendars from daily, weekly, and monthly. The tasks can be ranked differently by the users attributes that it defines them with: Class rank, Priority, or how many points an assignment is worth. Finally the user can opt in for notification settings that will alert the user when a task needs to get done and they can chagne when the alert will come out based on time from due date. 

# Anticipated Technologies
* JDK
* Android Command line tools
* Git repository
* XCode
* Gradle

# Method/Approach

Our plan of attack for this project is to get a baseline GUI working for the calendar/agenda part. Then once we have that we will split off into our individually assigned tasks and finish the project from there. If one of the assignments is harder than the others then we can help the groupmate assigned with that task in order to finish the project effectively and efficiently.

# Estimated Timeline

(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)
* Getting a running calendar GUI for agenda (2-3 weeks)
* Successfully add tasks to the calendar with due dates and times (3-5 days)
* Being able to tasks if inputed incorrectly (2 days)
* Being able to checkoff tasks when completed (3-5 days)
* Create a system that prioritizes tasks based on urgency of due date (2 weeks)
* Notification system that sends alerts to what tasks need to get done soon (3-4 weeks)

# Anticipated Problems
* Finishing the project and keeping all our intended features
* Getting our app to work on a mobile device and not just on a GUI
* Getting everything to look good and how we want it for a nice clean user friendly appearance
* Getting the notification feature to work
