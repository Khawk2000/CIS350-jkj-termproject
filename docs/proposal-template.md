# Introduction

(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)
Our project will be about designing an Android app for college and high school level students. The app will help remind the studnets when homework assignments are due, it will send a series of notifications to the user to make sure the homework/task was fininshed. We want to make a digital planner app that can also help take some difficulty out of everyday life. Our app, "HomeworkHelp" will be used as a tool for the busy students' life to help them with their everyday tasks.

The user can add tasks, delete or change the tasks. The tasks themselves can be customized with individual notes like which class is it for, how many points is it worth, priority level and due date. The user can then view the tasks in a range of calendars from daily, weekly, and monthly. The tasks can be ranked differently by the users attributes that it defines them with: Class rank, Priority, or how many points an assignment is worth. Finally the user can opt in for notification settings that will alert the user when a task needs to get done and they can chagne when the alert will come out based on time from due date.
